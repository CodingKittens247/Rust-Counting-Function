This is a part of a challenge by the Rust Lang book, in the end of ch8.3
The code is quite simple and self explanatory, using this as merely a bridge for the full exercise, since it is much more complicated compared to previous ones,  and I will attempt to make it a cmd utility for all the exercises.

"Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list."

Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and ay is added, so first becomes irst-fay. Words that start with a vowel have hay added to the end instead (apple becomes apple-hay). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!

"Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically."

Given these exercises, I will attempt to use the methods talked about in previous chapters, such as declaring sub modules, and APIs to solve this problem.
