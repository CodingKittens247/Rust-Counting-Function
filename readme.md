The code is quite simple and self explanatory, using this as merely a bridge for the full exercise, since it is much more complicated compared to previous ones, and I will attempt to make it a cmd utility for all the exercises.This is a part of a challenge by the Rust Lang book, in the end of ch8.3

In short,

- [ ] make an API, that when given a vector that returns the median and mode
- [ ] Pig Latin string concotenation
- [ ] Make a tgui to edit lists of names and add suffixes, that can be indexed, alphabetically.

Given these exercises, I will attempt to use the methods talked about in previous chapters, such as declaring sub modules, and APIs to solve this problem.
